            <p class="content">
                The arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator under the rules and procedures of the American
                Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
                (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information about AAA, please
                visit its website: http://www.adr.org. For information about the AAA Rules and Consumer Dispute Fees, please visit
                the AAA Consumer Arbitration page at: http://www.adr.org/consumer_ Arbitration. If there is any inconsistency
                between any provision of the AAA Rules and any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable provision
                of this Arbitration Agreement will control, unless the arbitrator determines that application of the inconsistent
                Arbitration Agreement provision would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
                follow the provisions of these Terms of Service like a court. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                including, but not limited to, issues related to the scope, enforceability and arbitrability of this Arbitration
                Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are generally simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
                judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief that a court
                would award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. The arbitrator's decision is
                enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

                Unless SUPE AI Darling and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will be held at a location reasonably
                convenient to both parties, with due regard to the parties' ability to travel and other relevant circumstances. If
                the parties cannot agree on a location, the decision will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
                SUPE AI Darling agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of
                documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as set forth in the AAA
                Rules. If your claim is for more than $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
                Regardless of how the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that is reasoned and
                sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
